Beachbox is an example game for KallistiOS using raylib4Dreamcast.

This project showcases how to use raylib on KOS, saving / loading, KOS threading, VMU animations, 
BIOS saving icon/animations and eyecatch, and more

To build, just run make.

Objective of the game:
	The goal is to survive as long as you can, while collecting coins to spend on upgrades and unlockables.
	
	There are two dimensions which the player can shift between by pressing the X button,
	enabling you to collide with both coins and walls on the same dimension.
	
	The green wall can only be passed by using the teleport power.

Controls:
	D-pad / Thumbstick to move
	A to jump
	X to shift between dimensions
	L to use the slowdown power
	R to use the teleport power

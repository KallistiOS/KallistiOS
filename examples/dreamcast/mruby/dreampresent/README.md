# Dreampresent: The Dreamcast Presentation Tool

This is a presentation tool that runs on **Sega Dreamcast**. It's written in 
**Ruby** and uses [mruby](https://mruby.org/).

This tool was initially developed by [Yuji Yokoo](https://github.com/yujiyokoo) 
for the **RubyConf TW 2019** event; then it was later updated for the
**RubyConf AU 2020** event. This project has been refactored by [MickaÃ«l 
"SiZiOUS" Cardoso](https://github.com/sizious).

## Compiling

To compile this, you need to install the `mruby`, `libpng` and `zlib` KallistiOS
Port, using the `kos-ports` repository.

## Usage

You can use `A` or `START` to move forward, and use `B` to go back to the
previous page.

Hold `A + B + Start` to quit.

The bottom of the screen shows the page progress and time progress (blue
dreamcast swirl for page, red mruby for time).

The time is currently hardcoded to `35` minutes.

If you press `Right` on the D-pad, you move the time forward by 5 minutes,
and back by 5 minutes if you press `Left`.

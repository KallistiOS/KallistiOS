# mrbtris: Sample game for Sega Dreamcast written in Ruby

**mrbtris** is a simple game for the **Sega Dreamcast** which is written in
**Ruby** as an proof-of-concept of using the [mruby](https://mruby.org/)
implementation on the Sega Dreamcast. This project was written by
[@yujiyokoo](https://github.com/yujiyokoo).

This project aims to provide a simple example of how to use **KallistiOS** (KOS)
API and **mruby** together.

## TODO

* Make an `mrbgem` for the Dreamcast specific things
* Create unit tests
* Use more Sega Dreamcast features

## Final note

The initial source is available [here](https://github.com/yujiyokoo/mrbtris-dreamcast).
This version of the source code is almost the same but adapted to be included as
an example in KallistiOS, with Yuji Yokoo approval.

# Mrbtris: Sample game for Sega Dreamcast written in Ruby

**Mrbtris** is a sample game for the **Sega Dreamcast** which is written in
**Ruby** as an proof-of-concept of using [mruby](https://mruby.org/).

This project aims to provide a pratical example of how to use **KallistiOS**
(KOS) API and **mruby** together.

This program was initially developed by [Yuji Yokoo](https://github.com/yujiyokoo) 
for the **RubyConf TW 2019** event; then it was later updated for the
**RubyConf AU 2020** event. This project has been refactored by [MickaÃ«l
"SiZiOUS" Cardoso](https://github.com/sizious).

## Compiling

To compile this, you need to install the `mruby` KallistiOS Port, using the
`kos-ports` repository.

## Todo

* Make an `mrbgem` for the Dreamcast specific things
* Create unit tests
* Use more Sega Dreamcast features

## Final note

This version of the source code is almost the same but adapted to be included as
an example in KallistiOS, with Yuji Yokoo approval.

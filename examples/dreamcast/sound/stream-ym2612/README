This example make use of `snd_stream_set_callback_direct`, `spu_dma_transfer` and `snd_stream_start_streams` functions.
An YM2612 interpreter is used to synthetize audio samples including real-time channel panning. The interpreter is implemented from [https://github.com/vgmrips/vgmplay-legacy](https://github.com/vgmrips/vgmplay-legacy "VGMPlay (legacy)").
VGM files can not be used directly here because is a hassle parse it. A "compacted" version of the format is used.

## Notes

- Result ccl file size should not be bigger than 10MiB.
- Build with optimizations (with `-O1` should be enough), synthetize audio samples is quite expensive.
- Panning starts to drift after consecutive loops, reason is unkwown.
- One of the FM channels may be silent because is reversed for SFX playback.

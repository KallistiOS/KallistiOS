## KallistiOS

KallistiOS is licensed under the terms of the "new" BSD license. We are 
calling our version of this license with the KOS copyright notice the **KOS
License**. For all files that are copyrighted by the authors of KallistiOS
(Megan Potter, etc), or for any file which does not otherwise specify
(and does not come from a third-party package like newlib), you can assume

## Addons and Utils

Some of the software included with KallistiOS is not copyrighted by us, nor
is it part of the codebase of KallistiOS. Most of that code will be found
within the "utils" directory and the "addons" directory. Licenses on these
pieces vary; please see the source of the program in question to be sure.

### kos-ports

The kos-ports repository provides ports of libraries with a variety of
licenses. For each, the applicable license is noted in its Makefile as
the LICENSE define. This can also be verified with the original authors.
Please review and be aware of these licenses if you wish to use kos-ports.

## More licensing information

If there is ever a question or you want to ask permission to do something
else with it, please contact the authors and we'll see how we can accommodate
you.

The Free Software Foundation has a very good source of information on
the various licenses. Please see this page if you have license compatibility

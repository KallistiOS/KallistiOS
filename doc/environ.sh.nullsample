# KallistiOS Environment Settings
#
# This is a sample script for configuring and customizing your
# KOS build environment. Modify it to suit your setup. Several
# settings may be enabled optionally or are provided with
# alternative values.
#
# This script is typically sourced in your current shell environment
# (probably by .bashrc, .bash_profile, or something similar), so that
# the KOS environment is set up automatically for each shell session.
#

# Build Architecture
#
# Set the major architecture you'll be building for.
# The only option here is "dreamcast" as of KOS 2.0.0.
#
export KOS_ARCH="null"

# KOS Root Path
#
# Specifies the path to the KOS root directory
#
export KOS_BASE="/home/quzar/dcdev/KallistiOS"

export KOS_PORTS="/home/quzar/dcdev/kos-ports"

export KOS_TOOLC_BASE="/usr"

# Host Compiler Prefixes
#
# Specifies the path to and prefix for your host toolchain.
#
export KOS_CC_BASE="${KOS_TOOLC_BASE}" 
export KOS_CC_PREFIX="x86_64-linux-gnu"

# Genromfs Utility Path
#
# Specifies the path to the utility which is used by KOS
# to create romdisk filesystem images.
#
export KOS_GENROMFS="${KOS_BASE}/utils/genromfs/genromfs"

# Make Utility
#
# Configures the tool to be used as the main "make" utility
# for building GNU Makefiles. On a platform such as BSD,
# the default can be changed to "gmake," for the GNU
# implementation.
#
export KOS_MAKE="make"

# Default Compiler Flags
#
# Resets build flags. You can also initialize them to some preset
# default values here if you wish.
#
export KOS_INC_PATHS=""
export KOS_CFLAGS=""
export KOS_CPPFLAGS=""
export KOS_LDFLAGS=""
export KOS_AFLAGS=""

# Debug Builds
#
# Controls whether to disable additional debugging checks and assertions,
# such as for parameter validation or internal errors. Uncomment this if
# you do not wish to compile with this additional logic enabled.
#
#export KOS_CFLAGS="${KOS_CFLAGS} -DNDEBUG"
#export KOS_CFLAGS="${KOS_CFLAGS} -DDBGLOG_DISABLED"

# Optimization Level
#
# Controls the baseline optimization level to use when building.
# Typically this is -Og (debugging), -O0, -O1, -O2, or -O3.
# NOTE: For our target, -O4 is a valid optimization level that has
# been seen to have some performance impact as well.
#
export KOS_CFLAGS="${KOS_CFLAGS} -O2 -Wall -fanalyzer"


# Shared Compiler Configuration
#
# Include sub architecture-independent configuration file for shared
# environment settings. If you want to configure additional compiler
# options or see where other build flags are set, look at this file.

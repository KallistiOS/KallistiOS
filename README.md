KallistiOS
===

**KallistiOS** (**KOS**) is an unofficial development environment for the **SEGA Dreamcast** (**DC**) game console.

It was developed from scratch over the internet by a group of free software developers, and has no relation to the old official **Katana** or **Windows CE** software development kits (**SDK**).


Documentation
-------------

For all documentation, please look in the `doc` directory.
Please read *at least* the main `README` file before trying to begin!

You will need to set up an environment variable file (`environ.sh`), build an **SH4** and **ARM** cross-compiler, build `kos` and optionally `kos-ports`.

A more complete installation script, guide as well as programming tutorials may be found [in the wiki](http://dcemulation.org/?title=Development).

[Ask for help on the forums](http://dcemulation.org/phpBB/viewforum.php?f=29).
